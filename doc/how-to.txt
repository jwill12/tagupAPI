The approach I followed for this problem was to directly answer the questions in mind when it came to following the CRUD process of RESTful APIs. I wanted to make sure my API, exemplfied Creating, Reading, and Updating, and Deleting any piece of data that went in and out the system.

Design wise, I choose to keep libaries fairly inhouse by using local data structures within Python. I chose to make sure I stuck with the Python dictionary structure, as their are many similiarities between it and JSONs structure. It provided for easy to use changes and updates as I paved through system design.

My API essentially runs through various methods, as the CRUD process demands. Their is a create, read, update, and delete method, along with a runapi method that wraps through and drives through the problem.
